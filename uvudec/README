This application is primarily targetted at embedded platforms.  These typically
have relativly simple instruction sets that can be easily represented by a
simple opcode configuration file.  This program will not be fast, but the
idea is to try to make new architectures easy to support.

Generic compiler target support is under development.  Currently assemblers
and compilers are isolated, but should soon be unified.



FAQ

Q: How do I add support for a new processor?
A: Look at the 8051 example.  Please send in a file you created if you found
it remotely useful for some architecture!

Q: But I need feature X for the new processor?
A: Some features are known to be lacking that will hopefully be supported
soon.  Contact me if you'd really like the feature and I can try to work on it
or work with you/someone to generate a patch for it.

Q: Is a GUI planned?
A: Eventually.  Probably Python based.

Q: Can I use this is a library for application X?
A: WIth minor modifications you probably could.  That was the original intent
and I have tried to keep it with relativly clean external interfaces to allow
for that.  I can provide a C interface if desirable.

Q: Why are object libraries distributed as hashes rather than binaries?
A: Mostly due to legal isues.  While SDCC libraries are likely to be freely
distributable, I'm not sure on legalities of distributing reverse engineered
binaries.

Q: What would really help this project?
A: Embedded compilers (if its permissible to give it to me) and system images.

Q: What was used to test this?
A: An 80C32 image from a laser was the base image.  As a non-biased testing
sample, I have 80C32 images from Cisco switches.

Q: Why are assemblers listed as "compilers"?
A: Because they're close enough for the purpose of this project.

Q: Why can a compiler and an architecture be added dynamically but not
programming languages?
A: Serously, how often do you need to add a new language?  Too complicated and
not enough ROI.

Q: Why not use libelf for ELF support?
A: libelf didn't appear to do the relocations for me, which was most of the
heavy lifting.  Actual ELF files are not hard to write to, so it made much
cleaner code not to bother and just use elf.h

Q: What is the EM_UVUDEC value?
A: TIS only defines a limited number of EM_* values.  The scope of this project
easily leads itself to needing to specify many non-standard architectures.
Additionally, many architectures need to be further refined from the base EM_*
value, such as defining the differences between different MIPS processor cores.
To make using other tools easy as possible though, if a standard value exists,
e_machine will be set to the standard value.  Always check for the .uvudec
section for extended information even if a base architecture is specified.
If there is a conflict, you probably want to take the .uvudec section value.

Q: How did you chose the EM_UVUDEC value?
A:
In <elf.h>:
If it is necessary to assign new unofficial EM_* values, please
pick large random numbers (0x8523, 0xa7f2, etc.) to minimize the
chances of collision with official or non-GNU unofficial values.

Building

You must select an embedded interpreter to use.  The simplest, but (currently)
slowest is to use the system's python interpeter.  Currently reccomended is to
use SpiderApe.  Easiest way if you are having issues is to get the jumbo
source that includes all non-trivial supporting source code.  

Currently all development is done on CentOS 5.3.  There are likely to be
errors that are trivially fixed that are generated on other platforms (ie bad
include assumptions).  I will try to fix this as it gets closer to Alpha
status.

Notes on different interpreters:
- SpiderApe: should be built without plugin support to make it a static
  executable (./configure --disable-plugins).
- Python: uses system().  Python.h APIs and boost explored, but nothing
  feasible enough to be happy with.
- Lua: this was abandoned since Lua dosn't have bitwise operations and would
  have been a pain otherwise.


Data files

Support for this is still under development at the time of this writting.
Several ways to add binary data
-As a text file.

Analysis data

Analysis data currently can only be read from directories.  It will be 
distributed as .tar.bz2 files and eventually should be directly readable and
writable in this form.
Symbol names are generated as a combination of the original executable and the
symbol's offset in the file.  Resolving into actual symbol names is not fully
worked out yet.  Likely a symbol with known value will propagate into an
unknown archive.
