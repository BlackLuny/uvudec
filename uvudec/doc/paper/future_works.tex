In the future we would like to complete the project and actually perform 
a collision attack. In order to accomplish this the transport subsystem
must first be improved and retested. 

With 128 nodes each with 2GB of memory, and each node estimated at 
1,000,000 hashes / second based on 30MB/s file storage throughput, 
the entire run should take just under 70 seconds. The result will be a 75\%
collision probability. Transport is likely to remain the bottleneck. With
100,000 hashes being received per node per second the run would then take 700 seconds.

Once complete, the code can also be trivially applied to parallelized rainbow
table generation for password cracking. In addition seemingly infeasible larger hashes
can be attacked using breakthroughs in cryptographic analysis to achieve collisions.
The subsystems developed can be directly applied to those attacks.
