Presented is a distributed birthday attack engine targeted at DES.  
Variations of the storage engine are discussed including memory and disk based options.  
An MPI communication layer is used to distribute information between nodes used in the attack.  
Several implemenations of DES are evaulated based and GnuPG was found to be the best suited implementation.
Using an optimized version of GnuPG,we demonstrate the time required to perform an attack using this system.  
We then compare these metrics with other related systems.
Each part of the system is somewhat isolated from the others to facilitate with benchmarking 
and other performance tuning.  Each part of the system is analyzed and overall performance
bottlenecks are demonstrated
Future work is then presented with how the system may be further improved.
