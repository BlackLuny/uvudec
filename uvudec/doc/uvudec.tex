\begin{abstract}
Toolsuite for analysis of executable binaries.  There are several competitors to this project such as Hex-Rays/IDA and REC.
Hex-Rays is very expensive and, being commercial software, does not allow strong collaborative development.
REC (Reverse Engineering Compiler) supports several architectures and is of decent quality, but is closed source, so also does
not allow collaborative development.
