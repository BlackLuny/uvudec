Possible libraries
	piklab
		GPL V2
		Should try to make lib w/ their various formats
		OMF and hex parsers
		no S-record?
		However, uses QT integration which annoyed me with the piclab project in the first place from user's perpsective, let alone dev
		May still give guidance to parsing and port it
	srecord
		http://srecord.sourceforge.net
		GPL V3
		built libsrecord.a
			wa who!
			no dynamic, will "have" to be statically linked unless I want to make my own .so
		looks like it might support a variety of formats
		good prospect
		C++ interface
		Well documented
