Known issues

TODO
-Improve complicated operand printing
-Function call resolution in DB functions
	Resolves relative call issues
	Normalize values to make even hashes?
		Immediates
		Addresses
-Export functions to database
	Will allow perfect decompilation of known coderee
	In progress...connected.
-Support more architectures
-Support config pre-processor
	Allows inheritance of processor families
-Parse while loops
-Parse for loops
-Parse if/else
-Intelligent conditionals
	Instead of
		temp = i - 32;
		if( temp > 0 )
			temp = 64 - i
			if( temp > 0 )
	Use
		if( i > 32 && i < 64 )
	Could also be done as part of a logic analyzer
-Parse switch (early impl as if?)
-Target decompilation for actual assemblers/compilers
-Create a C interface, if desired
-Trim non-coding parts of code
	Ex: function may have a few bytes padding after RET for alignment on next function
-Logic/flow analyzer
	Find independance of variables
-Stop memory leaks: fill in destructors
