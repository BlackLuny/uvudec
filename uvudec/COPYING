This project may be licensed under the Lesser General Public Licenes V3, or, at
your discression, a later version.  See file GPL for details.  While originally
I wanted this under BSD licensing, dependency projects made it difficult to
effectivly write code for without being in murky waters.  LGPL is a good
compromise anyway between omeone taking this and being able to use it without
giving back.
