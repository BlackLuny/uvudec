This project may be licensed under the Lesser General Public Licenes V3, or, at
your discression, a later version.  See file GPL for details.  While originally
I wanted this under BSD licensing, dependency projects made it difficult to
effectivly write code for without being in murky waters.  Although this doesn't
get around this and I haven't integrated those yet, LGPL is a good compromise
anyway between someone taking this and being able to use it without
giving back.  Plus, if I want to later integrate to those projects, I can
easily switch over.  Most likely, I'll write plugins for them and drop the
plugins if they somehow became an issue.
