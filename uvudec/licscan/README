uvlicscan

FLIRT signatures were a priority target so a license scanner could be
implemented.  While any binary format could be made, binary compatibility
with commercial tools allows existing tools to interoperate.
Goals of uvlicscan:
-Find code violating open source licenses
-Generate and encourage the generation of open library signatures
-High performance testing of the uvudec engine
-An early end application of the decompiling engine

Requirements
-Distributed arhictecture
	A program can query across multiple servers
